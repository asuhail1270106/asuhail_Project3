          <h2> Summary </h2>
          <p> Graduating High School at 16, I found myself unsure about what I would do in the future. 
	      I followed my family’s advice and became a Biology major, but as time passed I decided to change my major 
	      and came to the College of DuPage to pursue a degree in Computer Sciences. After taking a few classes in both 
	      Computer Sciences and Information Technology, I realized IT interests me more. I have taken several PC maintenance 
	      and networking classes. I am currently in the process of obtaining a Co-terminal Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree from the 
	      Illinois Institute of Technology in ITM and Data Center Operations and Management respectively. I plan on continuing in this 
	      field to gain my degrees and eventually start a career. </p>

          <h2> Skills and Awards </h2>
          <h3> Software </h3>
          <p> Since getting my first computer, by immersion, I have learned Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. 
	      After taking the Intro to computer systems class at COD, I have become a bit more proficient, 
	      but I am yearning to learn more. </p>
          <h2> Science Olympiad </h2>
          <p> I was in Science Olympiad all three years in high school, and won 9 medals (2 first place, 4 second place, and 3 third place). 
  	      Science Olympiad is a non-profit organization that hold competitions for competing schools in many different scientific 
	      subjects to improve the quality of science education. </p>

          <h2> Employment History </h2>
          <h3> Shift Leader, Dunkin’ Donuts </h3>
          <p> Feb, 2013 – Aug, 2014 </p>
          <p> I worked here for a year and a half, doing everything from making bagels to sweeping, 
              I was also in charge when the manager was unavailable. </p>
          <h3> Employee, Khan Consultants </h3>
          <p> Dec, 2014 – Mar, 2015 </p>
          <p> A company that offers products and services using 3d imaging technology for various tasks. 
	      Here I made 3d models of objects and used the model to compare it to its original blueprint. 
	      I left because it was not relevant to my major and I felt I should find work that will allow me to increase my 
              knowledge and give me experience in my field. </p>
